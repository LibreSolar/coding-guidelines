# JavaScript / TypeScript Coding Style

The code is formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with the [.prettierrc](.prettierrc) provided in this repo.

The Prettier configuration is mostly keeping the [default configuration](https://prettier.io/docs/options) (double quotes for strings, two spaces for indentation, trailing commas and semicolons, etc.).

Double quotes are used for strings in order to be consistent with other programming languages like C/C++, Rust, Go, Kotlin as well as the JSON format.

**ToDo:** ESLint config
